 Classification of cancer cells

 In this project, I analyzed the BreastCancer dataset from the mlbench package to classify tumors
 as benign or malignant. After preprocessing (handling missing values, converting features
 to numerical values, and scaling), I trained and evaluated five classification models:
 Logistic Regression, knn, Decision Tree, Neural Network, and Naive Bayes. 


 - Cl.thickness – thickness of the epithelial cell layer
 - Cell.size – uniformity of cell size
 - Cell.shape – uniformity of cell shape
 - Marg.adhesion – adhesion of marginal cells
 - Epith.c.size – size of epithelial cells
 - Bare.nuclei – number of exposed cell nuclei
 - Bl.cromatin – chromatin texture (nuclear color)
 - Normal.nucleoli – number of normal nucleoli
 - Mitoses – number of mitoses
 - Class – diagnosis class: “benign” or “malignant”
